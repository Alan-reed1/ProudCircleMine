# Discord Bot:
The Proud Circle Guild (https://plancke.io/hypixel/guild/player/illyum) has a public discord community (http://discord.gg/7kR4tMKvh6). In this server, players with the most weekly gexp are given certain roles following this criteria:

- [ 🏆 ] Champion -> #1 Weekly Gexp
- [ ❤️ ] Celestial -> #2 and #3 Weekly Gexp
- [⭐] Legend -> #4-#10 Weekly Gexp

This discord bot will check all player's guild xp contributions weekly and automatically assign the correct roles to all discord members.
If a discord member has linked their discord account with their hypixel account (using /link) a mineflayer bot will also automatically promote/demote each linked player on the Hypixel Network and change their Guild Role.
